# Breakout - University Project
This project was to implement a playable version of the video game breakout. The basic concept of the game consists of a paddle and a puck, which can be bounced around the arena to destroy floating blocks. The aim is to clear all of the blocks in a level, without letting the puck fall past the paddle. This project extended this design with multiple block types, and the introduction of power-ups which could appear on the blocks as well.

Developed in the Unity engine with game scripts written in C#.
